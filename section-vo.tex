\section{VO}
\begin{itemize}
  \item SFM: 3D reconstruction and pose estimation from image sets.
  \item VO: focus on estimation and local consistency.
  \item SLAM: focus on gloval consistence. VSLAM = visual odometry +
    loop closure + graph optimization.
\end{itemize}

Why VO?
\begin{itemize}
  \item No wheel slip.
  \item More accurate trajectory estimates.
  \item GPS-denied environments.
\end{itemize}

Why not?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low illumination.
  \item A lot of moving objects.
  \item Not texture.
\end{itemize}

Solution: complementary sensor suite. Camera + IMU.
