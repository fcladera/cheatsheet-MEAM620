\section{VO}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{SFM}: 3D reconstruction and pose estimation from image sets.
  \item \textbf{VO}: focus on estimation and local consistency.
  \item \textbf{SLAM}: focus on gloval consistence. VSLAM = visual odometry +
    loop closure + graph optimization.
\end{itemize}

\alert{Why VO?}
No wheel slip.
More accurate trajectory estimates.
GPS-denied environments.

\alert{Why not?}
Low illumination.
A lot of moving objects.
Not texture.

\alert{Solution:} complementary sensor suite. Camera + IMU.
