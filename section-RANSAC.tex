\section{RANSAC}
\subsection*{Hough transform}
Parametrize objects that you are trying to fit. For each point, iterate
through all the objects that fit with this point. Plot in
parameter space$\rightarrow$ voting.

\alert{Issues:} Memory grows exponentially in parameter space. Need bounds.

\subsection*{Sample consensus}
RANSAC with all the points, count the one that has the most inliers.
\alert{Problem}: a lot of combinations.

\subsection*{RANSAC inliers}
$k = \dfrac{\log(1 - p_{success})}{\log(1 - \epsilon^M)}$\\
$k$: iterations, $p_{success}$: target success probability,
$\epsilon$: inlier proportion in set, $M$: min. number of points for
model.
